# ReJot MCP

The ReJot MCP is a tool that allows you to manage the ReJot manifest file.

## Testing

- The `.cursor/mcp.json` file in this repository should automatically be picked up by Cursor. You
  might need to enable it under Cursor Settings > MCP.
- Issuing a command like "show me manifest info for @rejot-manifest.json" should now work.
- When modifying the MCP code, the reload button has to be pressed in Cursor settings to reload the
  MCP.
