# Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)

In a service-oriented architecture, the Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) acts as an intermediary layer
between the frontend and numerous backend services. Rather than having the frontend interact
directly with each backend service, the BFF acts as a single point of entry for the frontend. This
moves complexity away from the UI layer, improves latency, and solves over-fetching of data. BFFs
are all about data, a perfect fit for ReJot's synchronization capabilities.

## Background

There are some terms you'll need to understand before we get started:

- **Data Store**: A database. The canonical owner of the data you want to migrate. Typically has
  some sort of schema.
- **Data Server**: The service that interacts with the data store. We see this as the logical
  "owner" of the data within the data store. Typically this service is stateless and is running in
  multiple (load balanced) instances. Contains authentication routines and other business logic.
- **Data Client**: An application that interacts with the server. This is usually (but not in this
  use case) a frontend or user-facing application. The client also has a backing data store, but
  this is usually ephemeral. It can be reconstructed from the data in the server/store.

## Method

In this use case, we'll have an extra data client that acts like the Backend-for-Frontend. We assume
that the setup before introducing ReJot is a service-oriented architecture. A number of teams own
their respective services with a backing data store. The team working on the frontend wants to
integrate data from multiple teams before sending it to the end-user.

The product teams have already set up publication rules for their data. The BFF data client is a
receiver of data owned by these teams. The data that is shared depends on the type of frontend
application we are dealing with. A back-office application would receive more data than a customer
facing application.

The BFF business logic code will be responsible for the authentication and authorization of the
requests coming in. This is important, as the data client would receives data related to all
customers, as opposed to only data of the customer issuing the request. The data client will also
forward any mutation commands received from the frontend to the appropriate data server. Note that
transformations to these commands can be freely applied, as the team thinks appropriate. The BFF
data client can also choose to only receive a subset of the server data.

The architecture of the BFF setup is quite typical of any architecture that contains a BFF. The
difference is in the way data is exchanged between the services. In a traditional setup,
