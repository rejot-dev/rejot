# Data Migration

Data evolution is one of the hardest problems in software engineering. ReJot makes moving data
between databases or clusters easy while also enabling smoother data migrations. Using our sync
engine, we can effortlessly create a read-copy of the new model while keeping writes on the old
version until fully verified.

In this use case, we will outline migrating data from a legacy database to a new database. The same
steps can be applied to migrating data to a new cluster, or a different schema in the same database.

## Background

There are some terms you'll need to understand before we get started:

- **Data Store**: A database. The canonical owner of the data you want to migrate. Typically has
  some sort of schema.
- **Data Server**: The service that interacts with the data store. We see this as the logical
  "owner" of the data within the data store. Typically this service is stateless and is running in
  multiple (load balanced) instances. Contains authentication routines and other business logic.
- **Data Client**: An application that interacts with the server. This is usually (but not in this
  use case) a frontend or user-facing application. The client also has a backing data store, but
  this is usually ephemeral. It can be reconstructed from the data in the server/store.

## Context

We'll be using the "Strangler Pattern" to migrate data from a legacy database to a new database.
This pattern involves creating a new data server that interacts with the new database. We'll then
slowly migrate data from the old database to the new one while keeping the old data server running
and serving requests. Once the data has been migrated, we'll switch over to the new data server.

The synchronization engine at the core of ReJot is designed to move data from a _data server_ to a
_data client_. If there are no transformations or access rules in place, this is a 1:1 mapping. Once
the client is up-to-date, the client contains a full copy of the data.

Business logic that is part of the data server can choose to atomically change data in the store. A
data client does not have this ability. It can only interact with the server through issuing
commands. The server then decides to honor the command or not.

## Method

The steps to take are (roughly) the following:

1. Create a new data client that follows the data server we want to migrate.
2. (Optional) Setup transformation rules to transform data from the old schema to the new one.
3. Wait for the data client to (almost)catch up to the data server.
4. Switch reads from the data server to the data client.
5. Promote the data client to be the new data server.
6. Get rid of the old data server.

There are some caveats to this method:

- If there are transformation rules in place, the business logic contained in the data server will
  need to be able to handle the old schema as well as the new schema.
- Since synchronization is an eventually consistent process, there is a small window where the data
  client may seem to have fully caught up, but there is still some data in transition. Thus, when
  promoting the client, we need to buffer any modifications that are currently being applied to the
  original server.
- In the case where the data store does not use commands, and instead writes directly to the store,
  it will not be trivial to promote the data client. Commands can be buffered, while direct writes
  can have arbitrary mutations that cannot be buffered. In that case it might be necessary to
  migrate some business logic first to use the more ReJot-friendly command pattern.

## Key Benefits

- **Zero Downtime**: Keep your system running while migrating data
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure no data is lost during the migration process
- **Verification**: Compare old and new data stores before switching
- **Rollback Safety**: Easily revert to the original system if needed

## Common Use Cases

- Database upgrades
- Schema changes
- Storage system migrations
- Cloud migrations
- Database replication setup
