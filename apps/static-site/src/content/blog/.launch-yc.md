ReJot is a database sync engine that helps engineering teams seamlessly share data across their
organization. Today, we're excited to be open-sourcing a key piece of the puzzle: our data catalog.

As companies scale, their architecture naturally shifts from a monolithic application to distributed
services, each managing its own data. This fragmentation leads to silos, which increases developer
autonomy but makes data discovery a challenge.

Our control plane provides a unified, overview of all data stores across an organization, giving
visibility into what data exists and where it resides. Data observability is major pain point in
many companies blocking deep product integrations. Our sync engine enables these integrations and
our data catalog helps developers find what they need.

## What's next

Sync

## The Catalog

System Overview – Document relationships between services and databases in a single interactive
view.

Schema Inspector – Explore database schemas visually, mapping tables, views, and their
relationships.

By making this open-source, we hope to provide teams with an easier way to manage and understand
their distributed data landscape—without vendor lock-in. How This Fits Into ReJot’s Vision

This is just the beginning. The data catalog lays the groundwork for our broader goal: making data
effortlessly available across teams. With ReJot, engineers won’t just find data—they’ll be able to
sync it seamlessly into their local databases, enabling faster development without complex
integrations. Join Us
