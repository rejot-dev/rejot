We are excited to announce the release of ReJot v0.2! ReJot is a replication engine that helps
developers share data between their microservices in a asynchronous and resilient way.

This release introduces a host of new features and improvements, with a major focus on expanding our
language support and enhancing observability.

## Python Support

The biggest addition in v0.2 is the introduction of a Python collector. You can now use ReJot to
collect schemas from your Python applications! This means you can now communicate between a Python
microservice and a TypeScript microservice.

Getting started with the Python collector is simple. Check out our
[updated documentation](/docs/reference/python) for instructions on how to integrate it into your
projects. A short example, of an account microservice in Python, that is replicated to a TypeScript
microservice follows.

You start by defining a public schema in Python. This schema contains information about the data
that is being replicated, and how it should be transformed.

```python
# Some file in: modules/schemas/users/account.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from rejot_contract.public_schema import (
    create_public_schema, PublicSchemaConfig, PostgresPublicSchemaConfigTransformation, Source, Version, create_postgres_public_schema_transformation
)

class Account(BaseModel):
    id: int
    email: str
    name: str

# Use the helper to create transformations for insertOrUpdate
transformations = create_postgres_public_schema_transformation(
    operation="insertOrUpdate",
    table="account",
    sql="SELECT id, email, name FROM account WHERE id = :id",
)

# Define a public schema
public = create_public_schema(
    public_schema_name="public-account",
    source=Source(dataStoreSlug="default-postgres"),
    output_schema=Account, # Or a JSON schema dict
    version=Version(major=1, minor=0),
    config=PublicSchemaConfig(
        publicSchemaType="postgres",
        transformations=transformations,
    ),
)
```

The consumer schema is defined in TypeScript. This schema will be used to consume the data from the
Python microservice. It can apply a transformation to the data before it is inserted into the
destination database, or it can just insert the data as is.

```typescript
// Some file in: typescript/modules/external/account.ts
import { z } from "zod";

import { createConsumerSchema } from "@rejot-dev/contract/consumer-schema";

const myConsumerSchema = createConsumerSchema("consumer-account", {
  source: {
    manifestSlug: "manifest-account",
    publicSchema: {
      name: "public-account",
      majorVersion: 1,
    },
  },
  config: {
    consumerSchemaType: "postgres",
    destinationDataStoreSlug: "default-postgres",
    sql: "INSERT INTO destination_account (id, email, name) VALUES (:id, :email, :name) ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET email = :email, name = :name",
  },
});

export default { myConsumerSchema };
```

These schemas can then be collected using the ReJot CLI:

```bash
rejot-cli collect modules.schemas.users.account.py typescript/modules/external/account.ts --print --check
```

## Enhanced Observability

In our ongoing effort to provide you with the best tools for monitoring and understanding your
systems, we've introduced a dedicated observability feature. This will give you deeper insights into
your data, making it easier to track, debug, and optimize your applications. Learn more about our
observability features in our [documentation](/docs/reference/metrics).

A quick overview can be seen in the following images:

## Updated example

The [example project](https://github.com/rejot-dev/example-microservice-ts) has been updated to
provide a more complete example of how to use ReJot, including workspaces, and observability.

## Other Improvements

Alongside these major features, v0.2 includes several other notable updates:

- **ARM64 Support**: We now provide `arm64` builds for our CLI, which is great news for developers
  using Apple Silicon Macs.
- **CLI Workspaces**: The `sync` command in our CLI now supports workspaces, making it more flexible
  for different project structures. The example project has been updated to use workspaces.
- **Documentation**: We've made numerous improvements to our documentation to make it clearer and
  more helpful. You can find the updated documentation [here](/docs).

We're proud of the progress in v0.2 and believe these updates will significantly improve your
experience with ReJot. As always, we welcome your feedback and contributions.
