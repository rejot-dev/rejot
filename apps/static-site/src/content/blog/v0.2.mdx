We are excited to announce the release of ReJot v0.2! This release introduces a host of new features
and improvements, with a major focus on expanding our language support and enhancing observability.

## Python Support

The biggest addition in v0.2 is the introduction of a Python collector. You can now use ReJot to
collect schemas from your Python applications!

Getting started with the Python collector is simple. Check out our
[updated documentation](/docs/reference/python) for instructions on how to integrate it into your
projects.

## Enhanced Observability

In our ongoing effort to provide you with the best tools for monitoring and understanding your
systems, we've introduced a dedicated observability feature. This will give you deeper insights into
your data, making it easier to track, debug, and optimize your applications. Learn more about our
observability features in our [documentation](/docs/reference/metrics).

A quick overview can be seen in the following images:

## Updated example

The [example project](https://github.com/rejot-dev/example-microservice-ts) has been updated to
provide a more complete example of how to use ReJot, including workspaces, and observability.

## Other Improvements

Alongside these major features, v0.2 includes several other notable updates:

- **ARM64 Support**: We now provide `arm64` builds for our CLI, which is great news for developers
  using Apple Silicon Macs.
- **CLI Workspaces**: The `sync` command in our CLI now supports workspaces, making it more flexible
  for different project structures. The example project has been updated to use workspaces.
- **Documentation**: We've made numerous improvements to our documentation to make it clearer and
  more helpful. You can find the updated documentation [here](/docs).

We're proud of the progress in v0.2 and believe these updates will significantly improve your
experience with ReJot. As always, we welcome your feedback and contributions.
