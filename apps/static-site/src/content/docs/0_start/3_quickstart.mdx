This guide helps you quickly set up replication between PostgreSQL database instances using ReJot.
For demonstration purposes we'll use one Postgres database for both publishing and consuming data
and configure it using a single manifest file and with no external event store.

## Prerequisites

- [Install the `rejot-cli`](/docs/start/install)
- [Prepare a Postgres source](/docs/guides/setup-postgres) database

## Create a ReJot Manifest

First, we'll have to initialize a [Manifest](/docs/spec/manifest) file. This file contains all
configuration that ReJot needs in order to sync between datastores. By default this will create a
`rejot-manifest.json` file in the working directory.

```bash
rejot-cli manifest init --slug "my-sync-project"
```

### Add Database Connections

Configure connections to your source and destination databases. In this example, we'll use one
database as both source and destination, so we will need only one connection.

```bash
rejot-cli manifest connection add \
        --slug "my-db" \
        --type postgres \
        --database postgres \
        --host localhost \
        --password example \
        --port 5432 \
        --user postgres
```

### Set Up Data Store

Define a data store and attach it to the connection we just created.

```bash
# Source data store
rejot-cli manifest datastore add \
        --connection my-db \
        --publication rejot_publication \
        --slot rejot_slot
```

<Notice type="TIP">
  Quickly inspect your current manifest config using ```rejot-cli manifest info ```
</Notice>

### Set Up Event store

Next up we'll define an event store, an event store is used by ReJot to store Public Schema events
before replicating them to consumers. For demonstration purposes we'll use the same postgres
database connection we created before but generally a separate dedicated database is better suited.
The appropriate schemas and tables will be created on first launch.

```bash
rejot-cli manifest eventstore add \
        --connection my-db
```

### Define Public and Consumer Schemas

Our public and consumer schemas define what data is exposed from the datastore and how that exposed
data should be synced to the destination. For the publishing side, this is done through a simple
select query that will be run each time the source table is updated. The select query is responsible
for transforming the internal schema to the public schema and must include a `WHERE` clause using
the primary key for that table. Note that in the example query, the `$1` placeholder will be the
primary key value for incoming updates.

Public and Consumer Schemas can be created through Typescript code, create a `schemas.ts` file
containing your schemas. See our full [guide on defining schemas](/docs/guides/defining-schemas) for
more detailed description of the schema definition process.

<PreWithCopy noWrapper>
  <Code
    code={rawSchemaText}
    lang="ts"
    themes={{
      light: "github-light",
      dark: "github-dark",
    }}
  />
</PreWithCopy>

### Collect Schemas to Manifest

Before your newly defined schemas can be used, they must me collected into your manifest file. You
can do this using the `collect` command in the CLI. It might be nice to check your schemas are
correct first using the `--check` flag.

```bash
rejot-cli collect schemas.ts --check
```

If all looks good, you can materialize the schemas into your manifest.

```bash
rejot-cli collect schemas.ts --write
```

## Create Target Table in Destination

Before launching the synchronization process, create the target table in your destination database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE target_table (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, api_key TEXT NOT NULL);
```

## Start Synchronization

Start the synchronization process:

```bash
rejot-cli manifest sync --log-level info rejot-manifest.json
```

Any new writes to your source tables in the source datastore should now be transformed and written
into the destination datastore!
