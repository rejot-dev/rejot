The manifest is a JSON file that describes all of ReJot's configuration.

Manifests are used by Sync Services to understand what data needs to be synced where. Manifests may
be distributed over multiple files and usually follow organizational structure.

See our [guide](/docs/guides/managing-manifests) on how to set up your own manifests.

import ApiSchema from "@/components/schema/ApiSchema.astro";
import manifestSchema from "@/content/manifests/manifest_v0.json";

{/* TODO: actually generate this from the manifest jsonschema, and make sure its versioned, for now I ask the LLM to generate the structure below */}

<ApiSchema
  version={"v0"}
  globalSchema={manifestSchema}
  schemaRef="#/"
  externalKeys={["connections", "dataStores", "eventStores", "publicSchemas", "consumerSchemas"]}
/>
