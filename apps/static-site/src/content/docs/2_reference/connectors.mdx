We currently support PostgreSQL as both source and destination for sync. Our goal is to support most
major database providers.

| Database   | Version    | Source  | Sink    | Backfills | Event store |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | ----------- |
| PostgreSQL | &#8805; 15 | ✅      | ✅      | Planned   | ✅          |
| MySQL      |            | Planned | Planned | Planned   |             |
| MongoDB    |            | Planned | Planned | Planned   |             |
