title: "Metrics"

ReJot uses OpenTelemetry to collect metrics, which can be published to a variety of backends. See
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter/) for more
information. Currently, the metrics are only available in the sync command.

## Metrics Exporter

To enable metrics, set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable to the URL of the
OpenTelemetry collector.

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
```

## Prometheus

Another option is to use Prometheus. ReJot can publish metrics on a specific port, which can be
scraped by Prometheus or pushed to a Prometheus server. For more information see
[OpenTelemetry Documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/js/exporters/#prometheus).

### Push based

Configure Prometheus with the
[OTLP receiver flag](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/2.55/feature_flags/#otlp-receiver), and
point ReJot to the Prometheus server.

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9090/api/v1/otlp
```

### Pull based

Configure Prometheus to scrape ReJot's metrics endpoint, which is enabled by the setting
`REJOT_METRICS_PORT`.

```bash
export REJOT_METRICS_PORT=9464
```

Then configure Prometheus to scrape ReJot's metrics endpoint:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: rejot-cli
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: [localhost:9464]
```
