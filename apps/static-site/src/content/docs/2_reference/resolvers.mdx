Resolvers are components that determine how to connect to sync services based on manifest slugs.

## Localhost Resolver

A resolver for local development that always returns `localhost:port`. This is intended for
development purposes only and works with a single sync service.

```bash
rejot-cli manifest sync --resolver localhost
```

## Environment Resolver

Resolves hosts using environment variables. The format for environment variables is:

```
REJOT_SYNC_SERVICE_<slug>=<host>:<port>
```

Example:

```bash
REJOT_SYNC_SERVICE_MY_MANIFEST=my-service:3000
REJOT_SYNC_SERVICE_ANOTHER=another-service:4000
```

```bash
rejot-cli manifest sync --resolver env
```

### Kubernetes Resolver

A resolver for Kubernetes environments that constructs service DNS names following the Kubernetes
service naming convention. The hostname format is: <br/>
`rejot-manifest-<slug>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`
