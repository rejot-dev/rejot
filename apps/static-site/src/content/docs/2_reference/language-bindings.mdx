Language bindings enable developers to define public and consumer schemas using their preferred
programming language and existing package management infrastructure.

| Language              | Contracts (Public/Consumer Schema)  | Transformations                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | [@rejot-dev/contract][npm-contract] | [@rejot-dev/adapter-postgres][npm-pg] |
| Python                | [Python API](./python)              | Pydantic, SQL                         |

Python bindings are currently in development.
