title: "Data Contracts"
---

Data dependencies in ReJot are explicitly modeled, allowing engineering teams to maintain control
over how their data is exposed within the organization. By decoupling data producers from consumers,
data owners gain the flexibility to modify internal data models without impacting downstream
consumers.

Data producers can publish their data through a [Public Schema](/docs/spec/public-schema), while
consumers can subscribe to datasets through a [Consumer Schema](/docs/spec/consumer-schema).

## One-to-Many Relations

ReJot is designed to support one-to-many relationships between data producers and consumers. Each
public and consumer schema is versioned to accommodate changes in these data models. Note that this
requires an [Event Store](/docs/spec/event-store) in your setup.
