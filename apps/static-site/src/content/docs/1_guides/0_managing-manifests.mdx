title: "Managing Manifests"

import Notice from "@/components/Notice.astro";

This guide covers how to create and manage ReJot manifest files using the `rejot-cli manifest`
commands. ReJot uses [Manifests](/docs/spec/manifest) as a central configuration file that defines
your data synchronization setup. Think of it as a "lockfile" for your data contracts - it specifies
what data should be synced, where it should be synced, and in what format.

## Manifest Components

A manifest definition contains (a subset of) the following components:

- [Data stores](/docs/spec/data-store): Source databases that ReJot monitors for changes
- [Event stores](/docs/spec/event-store): Where ReJot stores and manages change events
- [Public Schemas](/docs/spec/public-schema): Define what data is exposed from your data stores
- [Consumer Schemas](/docs/spec/consumer-schema): Define how data is transformed and stored in
  target systems
- Workspaces: Group multiple manifests into a single project.

<Notice type="TIP">
  For AI-native code editors, the [ReJot MCP](/docs/start/install#mcp) server makes managing
  manifest files effortless.

## Initializing a Manifest

To create a new empty manifest file in the current directory, use the following command. Each
manifest requires a unique slug, which is used to identify where public schemas are exposed and
where sync services can locate them on the network.

```bash
rejot-cli manifest init --slug "my-sync-slug"
```

## Setting Up Data and Event Stores

Before configuring public and consumer schemas, you need to specify how ReJot should connect to your
databases and where the ReJot Event Store is located.

For each data store, ReJot will monitor changes to public schemas defined for that data store and
push those changes to the event store. While you can configure the event store to use the same
database, it's generally recommended to use a separate database.

<Notice type="WARNING">
  Database connection credentials can be stored in the ReJot Manifest file, but these should only be
  committed for development setups. See our [Composing Manifests](/docs/guides/composing-manifests)
  guide for examples on how to split your manifests up for different environments.

### Adding Database Connections

Let's start by adding the connection details:

```bash
rejot-cli manifest connection add \
            --slug "my-datastore" \
            --type postgres \
            --database postgres \
            --host localhost \
            --password example \
            --port 5432 \
            --user postgres
```

Alternatively, you can provide a connection string:

```bash
rejot-cli manifest connection add \
            --slug "my-datastore" \
            --connection-string "postgres://postgres:postgres@example:5432/postgres"
```

### Configuring Data Stores

Next, link a data store to the connection:

```bash
rejot-cli manifest datastore add \
            --connection my-datastore \
            --publication rejot_publication \
            --slot rejot_slot
```

There's an (implicit) difference between data stores with or without a publication and slot. Data
stores without these can only be used as a destination, while data stores with these can be used as
either a source or destination.

A data store can be removed from the manifest in the following way:

```bash
rejot-cli manifest datastore remove my-datastore
```

### Configuring Event Stores

Event stores are also based on a connection, but they don't require a publication or slot.

```bash
rejot-cli manifest eventstore add --connection my-eventstore
```

Similar to data stores, an event store can be removed from the manifest in the following way:

```bash
rejot-cli manifest eventstore remove my-eventstore
```

## Verifying Your Configuration

You can use the `info` command to display a parsed version of the manifest. When errors or warnings
are detected, they will be printed to the console.

```bash
$ rejot-cli manifest info
```

```
Manifest Configuration:

Connections:
  - my-datastore (postgres)
    Host: localhost:5432
    Database: postgres
    User: postgres
    string: postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/postgres

Data Stores (Replication Sources):
  - Connection: my-datastore
    Publication / slot: rejot_publication / rejot_slot

Event Stores (Replication Targets):
  - Connection: my-eventstore
```

## Workspaces

A ReJot workspace is a collection of manifests that are managed together. It's useful for local
development use cases where you're typically only using a single event store and only want to run a
single sync service. It can also be used to combine for example secrets and other configuration
across multiple manifests.

A manifest can link to other manifests using the `workspaces` field. This field should contain the
relative path to other manifest files.

```json
{
  "slug": "my-sync-slug",
  "workspaces": ["./service-one/rejot-manifest.json", "./service-two/rejot-manifest.json"]
}
```

The workspace manifest is typically in a parent directory related to other manifests. An example
structure might look like this:

```
my-monorepo/
├── service-one/
│   ├── rejot-manifest.json
│   └── ...
├── service-two/
│   ├── rejot-manifest.json
│   └── ...
└── rejot-manifest.json
```

When using the `collect` command, schemas are collected into the nearest manifest.
