When deploying sync services, you'll often need different configurations for various environments
(development, staging, production) or manifests that have different owners within the organization.
This guide explains strategies for structuring and managing your manifest file collections.

- **Database Connections**: Development, staging, and production typically use separate databases
  with different credentials or hostnames
- **Event Store Configurations**: Your event store might differ between development and production
- **Secret Management**: Production secrets are typically stored in secure vaults
- **Mono-repo vs Multi-repo**: Definitions might exist in completely separate code repositories
- **Ownership**: Different stakeholders in the organization might want to control specific schemas

## Environment-Specific Manifest Files

The most common reason to split manifest files is to separate environment-specific configuration and
secrets into distinct files.

```
/manifests
  ├── rejot-manifest.base.json
  ├── rejot-manifest.dev.json
  ├── rejot-manifest.staging.json
  └── rejot-manifest.prod.json
```

You'll typically need different connection configurations for each environment, which means your
base manifest won't specify any connections:

```json
// rejot-manifest.base.json
{
  "connections": [],
  "dataStores": ...,
  "publicSchemas": ...,
}
// rejot-manifest.dev.json
{
  "connections": [{
    "slug": "conn-datastore-a",
    "config": {
      "host": "localhost",
      ...
    }
  }]
}

// rejot-manifest.prod.json
{
  "connections": [{
    "slug": "conn-datastore-a",
    "config": {
      "host": "my-datastore-a.europe-west4.domain.com",
      ...
    }
  }]
}
```

When starting a sync service, you can pass multiple manifest files:

```bash
# Development
rejot-cli manifest sync rejot-manifest.base.json rejot-manifest.dev.json

# Production
rejot-cli manifest sync rejot-manifest.base.json rejot-manifest.prod.json
```
