When using ReJot, you define Public and Consumer schemas right from your codebase. This allows you
to group related pieces of code together. In this case you can define your public schemas close to
where you define the underlying database tables.

This guide will show you how to define (Postgres) schemas in your TypeScript codebase.

<Notice type="NOTE">
  If you want to use ReJot with a non-TypeScript codebase, you can modify your manifest directly to
  create schemas, or you can choose to define your schemas in TypeScript anyway.
</Notice>

## Setting Up

First, add the required dependencies to your project:

<LanguageVariants
  languages={[
    {
      title: "NPM",
      lang: "bash",
      code: `npm install --save @rejot-dev/contract @rejot-dev/adapter-postgres`,
    },
    {
      title: "Bun",
      lang: "bash",
      code: `bun add @rejot-dev/contract @rejot-dev/adapter-postgres`,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Creating Public and Consumer Schema Definitions

Create a new file called `schemas.ts` that will contain your public and consumer schemas:

<PreWithCopy noWrapper>
  <Code
    code={rawSchemaText}
    lang="ts"
    themes={{
      light: "github-light",
      dark: "github-dark",
    }}
  />
</PreWithCopy>

<Notice type="TIP">
  Make sure you adjust the data store and manifest slugs in this example to the manifest you've
  created.
</Notice>

### Transformations

Transformations are a crucial part of schema definitions that specify how data is transformed
between different stages of the sync process. Transformation are used by both the publishing and
consuming parties, for publishers, the transformation defines how data from the internal
representation should be mapped to the public schema. Conversely on the consuming side the
transformation maps the public schema back into an internal representation for the consumer.

#### Public Schema Transformations

For public schemas, you need to create a SQL transformation for each table referenced in the schema.
These transformations:

- Take the modified row as input parameters. They can be accessed in column order using positional
  parameters (e.g., `$1`, `$2`, etc). We also provide support for named parameters, using the name
  of the column. E.g. `:id`.
- MUST return exactly one row that matches the public schema's output structure.

Here's an example of a public schema transformation:

<PartialCode code={rawFullSchemaText} lang="ts" part="publicSchemaTransformations" />

<Notice type="IMPORTANT">
  The row returned from the transformation query must exactly match the public schema's output
  structure, including casing in column names. In Postgres, when not double-quoting column names,
  they are always returned in lowercase. It's recommended to always add an explicit "AS" statement,
  to ensure the casing is correct. E.g. `SELECT id, first_name AS "firstName" FROM my_table`.
</Notice>

#### Multi-table transformations

A common case is to (partially) de-normalize your data for the public schema, to ensure correct
results ReJot should listen to updates to all of these tables. As a data producer you will have to
define schema transformations for each table.

<PartialCode code={rawFullSchemaText} lang="ts" part="publicSchemaTransformationsMultiTable" />

<Notice type="NOTE">
  Note that your public schema transformation must always return one result, in case there is a
  one-to-many relationship between tables you cannot include them in your ReJot public schema
  without doing some kind aggregation in your query. For PostgreSQL, use one of the [aggregation
  functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html) that are available.
</Notice>

#### Consumer Schema Transformations

For consumer schemas, transformations handle the insertion of public schema data into the
destination data store. These transformations:

- Use named parameters (e.g., `:name`, `:country`) to reference fields from the public schema
- Must handle conflicts appropriately since ReJot doesn't guarantee exactly-once delivery

Here's an example of a consumer schema transformation:

<PartialCode code={rawFullSchemaText} lang="ts" part="consumerSchemaSql" />

## Materializing Schemas

Code-based schemas need to be materialized into your manifest file to be usable by sync services.
This is done using the `collect` command:

```bash
rejot-cli collect --write --check schemas.ts
```

This command will:

- Read your schema definitions from `schemas.ts`.
- Generate the corresponding manifest entries.
- Check that all consumer schemas are referencing valid public schemas (if `--check` is specified).
- Update your manifest file (if `--write` is specified).

The manifest includes a `definitionFile` key for each schema, which points to the actual source file
and is re-used later on to update collected schemas.

If you want to change a schema, edit the file referenced by `definitionFile` and run the collect
command again.

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to define schemas, you can
[run sync services](/docs/guides/running-sync-services) to start and manage sync services using
manifests.
