This guide explains how to prepare your PostgreSQL database as a Data Source or Event Store for use
with ReJot.

## Enabling Logical Replication

<Notice type="TIP">
  The only step absolutely required for ReJot to work is to enable logical replication. Creating
  custom roles and permissions is recommended for production use cases, but not necessary for
  development. ReJot will automatically create a replication slot, publication, schemas, and tables
  when the sync process is started.
</Notice>

Logical replication is not enabled by default in PostgreSQL. The configuration that manages logical
replication is called [`wal_level`][pg-wal-level], which must be set to `logical`. Note that
changing this config requires a database restart.

There are two methods to enable this config: either through the `postgresql.conf` file,

```sql
wal_level = 'logical'
```

or by setting it through SQL directly:

```sql
SHOW wal_level;

-- Inspect current setting
ALTER SYSTEM
SET
  wal_level = 'logical';
```

<Notice type="NOTE">
  Hosted PostgreSQL providers like Supabase, Neon, or Google Cloud SQL manage this setting via their
  own dashboards. When given the option to choose from a pooled connection or a dedicated
  connection, choose the dedicated connection.
</Notice>

## Postgres as a Source Data Store

Using a Postgres data store as a Source Data Store means that ReJot will listen to the logical
replication stream of that store and apply Public Schema transformations to its messages. ReJot
leverages PostgreSQL's logical replication stream using the `pgoutput` native plugin to capture
database changes.

### Replication Slots

A PostgreSQL replication slot is a mechanism that keeps track of changes replicated from a
publication for each subscriber, ensuring no changes are missed even if a subscriber disconnects
temporarily. It maintains a record of which changes have been consumed by subscribers and prevents
the deletion of Write-Ahead Log (WAL) segments until all subscribers have processed them.

<Notice type="TIP">
  In most cases it is **not** necessary to create a replication slot manually. ReJot will create a
  slot if it doesn't exist yet based on the data store config in your manifest.
</Notice>

### Creating a PostgreSQL Publication

A PostgreSQL [Publication][pg-create-publication] is defined on a primary Postgres node and
specifies which set of tables in a database can be replicated to other systems.

On first starting a Sync service, a publication is automatically created if it doesn't exist yet.
This publication includes all tables and is equivalent to:

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION rejot_publication FOR ALL TABLES;
```

If you prefer to control which tables are included in the publication, you can create the
publication manually:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION rejot_publication FOR TABLE some_table, another_table;
```

See the [PostgreSQL docs][pg-create-publication] for more details.

## Postgres as an Event Store

To use PostgreSQL as an event store, the user used to connect to the database must be able to create
a schema called `rejot_events`. The `rejot-cli` will create these schemas for you on launch. If you
don't want to give the `rejot_role` access to create schemas, you'll have to manually create these
schemas and assign the following roles to the `rejot_role`.

## Hardening the ReJot Database Role

We recommend creating a separate role for ReJot and granting access to that user for production use
cases. If you want to get started quickly, you can use an admin user instead. ReJot will create the
necessary schemas, databases, and tables automatically.

```sql
CREATE ROLE rejot_role
WITH
  REPLICATION LOGIN PASSWORD '<some secure password>';
```

### Source Data Store Permissions

To be able to read data from a source data store, ReJot must be able to create a replication slot,
publication, and must be able to issue `SELECT` statements on the tables being replicated.

To apply Public Schema transformations, the ReJot Postgres user must have the `SELECT` permission on
the relevant schemas (`public` by default).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO rejot_role;
```

### Destination Data Store Permissions

For ReJot's replication to function, we must be able to keep track of the last seen transaction ID
and the state of Public Schema transformations. This is done in the `rejot_data_store` schema. When
starting the sync service, ReJot will automatically run migrations to create the necessary schema
and tables. To do this, write permissions on the `rejot_data_store` schema are required.

### Event Store Permissions

Similar to the destination data store, ReJot will automatically run migrations to create the
necessary schema and tables needed for the event store. This is the `rejot_events` schema.

### Recommendations

For maximum security we recommend creating a separate role for ReJot and granting specific
permissions to that role. The replication slot, publication and schemas should be created manually
by a system administrator. Then the necessary permissions for the use case should be granted to the
ReJot role.

### Reference

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```sql
-- Create the schemas using a privileged user
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS rejot_events;

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS rejot_data_store;

-- Grant access to these new schemas to your unprivileged user
GRANT CREATE, USAGE ON SCHEMA rejot_events TO rejot_role;
GRANT CREATE, USAGE ON SCHEMA rejot_data_store TO rejot_role;


GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA rejot_data_store TO rejot_role;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA rejot_data_store TO rejot_role;

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA rejot_events TO rejot_role;
```
