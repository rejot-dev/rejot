title: "Manifest"

The manifest is a JSON file that describes all of ReJot's configuration.

Manifests are used by Sync Services to understand what data needs to be synced where. Manifests may
be distributed over multiple files and usually follow organizational structure. While we document
the schema of the manifest here, we suggest to modify the manifest through the `rejot-cli`.

See our [guide](/docs/guides/managing-manifests) on how to set up your own manifests.

import ApiSchema from "@/components/schema/ApiSchema.astro";
import manifestSchema from "@/content/manifests/manifest_v0.json";

<ApiSchema
  version={"v0"}
  globalSchema={manifestSchema}
  schemaRef="#/"
  externalKeys={["connections", "dataStores", "eventStores", "publicSchemas", "consumerSchemas"]}
/>
