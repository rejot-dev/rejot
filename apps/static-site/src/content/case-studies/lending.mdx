# Financial Technology Firm Lending Case Study

{/* "What project was this person trying to accomplish?" */}

In this study, we look at a financial technology firm that had been working on a business financing
product, this product would offer access to fast and flexible financing for small and medium-sized
businesses. At the same time, a team in a different division worked on extending their existing card
issuing product to include credit options. A problem materialized: The two products have a mutual
data dependency on the total lending position of a customer. ReJot was able to help unravel the
dependencies by providing deep data integration between teams through its synchronization engine.

## Key Results

- ReJot significantly reduced the time to market for the capital loan product. Development cycles
  were saved for both product managers and engineers.
- A single source of truth for the total lending position of a customer was created, reducing the
  risk of inconsistencies and errors. Minimal technical debt was created in the process.
- Product teams are empowered by staying in charge of their data, instead of becoming implicitly
  dependent on ETL pipelines. Any future product enhancements are not hindered.

## Project

{/* Context: "Why was this project on their critical path?" */}

For the FinTech firm, it is crucial to determine the total lending position of a customer before
approving a loan or any other financial product. For either of the two products to be able to go
live successfully, data from both teams needs to be integrated:

- Before setting a credit limit, any currently open capital loan must be taken into account.
- Before approving a capital loan, the customer's total credit limit and open credit must be known.

One key requirement is that this information needs to be considered in real-time, when the customer
requests a loan or a credit limit increase. This request is usually made through a REST API.

In this case, the firm decided to go live with the credit card product first, as it is an addition
to an existing product. Thus, the capital product had to be delayed. A decision had to be made on
how data would be shared between the two teams. To still be first to market with the financing
product, the teams had to improvise.

## Options

In an alignment meeting, the teams discussed a number of options available to them. The main goals
were to reduce time-to-market and minimize technical debt created, as both teams had their planning
to consider. The following options were discussed before the introduction of ReJot.

### Option 1: ETL - Reverse ETL

The company has an internal data platform capable of combining data from multiple sources. It seemed
like a decent choice for the problem at hand. Yet, there were some clear downsides:

- Data Analysts own the ETL pipelines at the company, alignment between product and data teams would
  delay the go-to-market date.
- ETL pipelines are batched, rather than real-time. Either one of the teams would have stale data
  (by a day for a nightly batch job) from the other team.
- Reverse ETL was not a typical use case for the data team, there was no clear path forward without
  involving infrastructure teams.

### Option 2: Event Streaming

An alternative considered was the event queuing/streaming platform for asynchronous communication
between teams. Again, a number of downsides would cause problems:

- Integrating events from another team would mean setting up bespoke consumers, something that would
  require additional development time. Both teams would need to integrate events from the other
  team, meaning they would both have to implement similar, yet different, logic.
- New topic-partitions would have to be created, something that was not self-service available to
  product teams at this company.

### Option 3: Intermediary Service

The last option would have both teams integrate with a to-be-created intermediary service. This
service would become the source of truth for any credit given out to a single customer. Although the
idea of having a single source of truth for credit limits is appealing, there would be several
downsides:

- The new service would require a significant amount of development time.
- Ownership of the new service would be unclear, as it would be used by multiple teams.
- The new service would have to be maintained, which would add to the _ongoing_ costs of the
  project(s).

## Using ReJot

{/* HOW exactly did they complete the project? (e.g., with help from your product) */}

ReJot's **integration through synchronization** approach changes the way the teams look at the
problem.

To solve the problem at hand, both teams defined a ReJot contract which represents the data used by
their respective products. This contract is automatically entered into the catalog of the company.
From this data, a "total lending position" is derived. ReJot's synchronization engine keeps the data
up-to-date. Both teams then use this data in their products, and make decisions based on it. This
elementary level of data modelling and integration is the simple strength of ReJot.

This solution is conceptually similar to the "Intermediary Service" option, but the downsides do not
apply because of the automatic synchronization.
