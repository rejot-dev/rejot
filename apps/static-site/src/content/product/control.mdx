# Control

In enterprise systems, we often think about access control on the level of endpoints. When a client
sends a request to an (API) endpoint the server probes some (de)central authority to figure out if
the request is allowed. A client in this case can be a user with a certain role, but it could also
be a service controlled by a different team.

Since ReJot is a data platform, we think about access control on a different layer. Our access
control system does not check **what action a user is allowed to do**, but rather, **which data a
system is allowed to see**. The system, in turn, is responsible for checking permissions of the user
using the service. This gives you a multi-layered access control system when using ReJot, which is
more flexible than the traditional approach.

This access control strategy makes it easier to stay compliant with regulations such as the GDPR and
CCPA. The teams that work directly with personal data usually have the most intimate knowledge of
what data is allowed to be shared. By giving them the ability to control what and how data is
shared, you can ensure that you are always compliant. ReJot combines _discretionary access control_
with other forms of access control (typically _role-based access control_) for maximum flexibility.
