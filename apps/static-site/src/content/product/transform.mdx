# Transform

Transformations are a natural part of any system that handles any amount of data. The way data is
structured in your database differs from how it's exposed via APIs, transmitted through webhooks, or
shared with other teams through event streaming. Data is constantly transformed to fit the needs of
the system that consumes it. ReJot aims to make transformations a first-class citizen of your data
platform.
