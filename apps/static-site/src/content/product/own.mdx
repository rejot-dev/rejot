# Own

It is widely accepted that when teams deliver more value when they have ownership over their code.
Autonomous teams are more productive and more innovative. We believe this holds even more so for
data. However, this belief is not as widely accepted just yet.

We have seen that enterprises often take shortcuts when it comes to data management. When looking
for actionable insights, it is tempting to directly read from a product team's database to extract
aggregations as needed. This comes back to bite the teams involved, as now the data model is
implicitly locked without the product team's consent. Misinterpretations of the data model are also
common. Teams expect their data model to be internal, and thus are under-documented. A business
analyst interpreting data differently can lead to taking incorrectly informed decisions later on.

At ReJot, we understand that data needs to be made available to whomever can extract value from it
very quickly. This is why ReJot makes it trivial define how data should be transformed and
published. By keeping the transformation rules next to the data model, we ensure that data can be
shared with consent and speed while keeping the ownership with the product team.
