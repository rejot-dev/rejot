  Automatically synchronize data from one datastore to another. This helps you answer analytical
  questions while staying in the business logic layer of your system.

# Synchronize

When building applications and dealing with data, we discern two distinct stages in the lifecycle of
data: the write and the read path. When using a typical client/server model the client requests data
fetches and mutations on demand. In the synchronization paradigm, we turn this model on its head.
Instead of requesting the data from the server when needed, we already synchronize the data from the
server to the client. This happens during the write path, meaning the data is already available
before it's even requested.

This has a number of tangible benefits:

- Performance is improved. Instead of fetching on-demand and waiting for several hundred
  milliseconds, the data is already available.
- The development process is simplified, as the developer can focus on the business logic rather
  than the data synchronization. This in turn reduces the turn-around time for new features.
- Product teams can more easily integrate data from other teams. This increases platform cohesion.

ReJot helps you to merge the write and read paths. By setting up connections between multiple
databases, or databases and apps, you get to reap the benefits of synchronization without the hassle
of setting up complex integrations. Our synchronization engine is built to scale and help you
achieve your goals quickly.
